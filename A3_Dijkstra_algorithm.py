# dijkstra algorithm

import heapq  # Imports the heapq module to use a priority queue (min-heap), which helps retrieve the node with the smallest distance efficiently.

    distances[start] = 0   #Sets the starting node's distance to 0.
    queue = [(0,start)]    # Adds the starting node to the priority queue with cost 0.

# A B 4
# A C 2
# B C 5
# B D 10
# C D 3
